      <p>
        My name is Phil Bohn and I graduated with a BS in Music Education from
        Duquesne University in 2013. I taught in Pittsburgh Catholic Grade
        Schools and at a local High School for about 5-6 years. I have not
        taught in schools since that high school job and most recently worked in
        Tech Support for ZOLL Medical Corporation working specifically with the
        LifeVest, a wearable defibrillator. I took this Boot Camp to prepare for
        a career pivot into CS and am very excited to start working on an App
        design with a coder friend. In my free time, I enjoy video and tabletop
        gaming, reading, watching movies/TV shows, and I am an avid follower of
        the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team.
